The input parameters are n (the number of points to be selected) and N (the total number of points available), both as integers, and a Random object for random selection.\n\nThe method first checks if the inputs are valid: n must be less than or equal to N, and both n and N must be non-negative.

If this selected index matches the current index iObj, it means that the last remaining element has been chosen. The method then adds the value stored at this index in map to vals and increments the counter selected. Otherwise, the method removes the index_rand from map, stores the corresponding element in map at index_rand (which could be the current index iObj or a random one), adds it to vals, and increments the counter selected.\n\nFinally, the method returns the array vals containing the indices of the n points selected.", "Original comment: Bui (2015) \"Cachediff: Fast Random Sampling\" URL\n\nUpdated comment: Bui (2015) \"drawSparseSample: A Fast Algorithm for Random Sampling\" URL\n\nOutput format:\n\n\"drawSparseSample: A Fast Algorithm for Random Sampling\" URL", "Draws a sparse sample of n points from an array of N elements.

The original comment should be retained except for any parts that have been updated due to the code modification.\n\nBefore making any updates, I need to understand what has changed between the original and updated method. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n1. The string \"Name: \" is followed by getName() in the original code, while it's followed by \"***Sensitive Data Redacted***\" in the updated code. This change indicates that we are now printing sensitive data as asterisks instead of the actual name.\n2. The string \"Value: \" is still being appended to the StringBuilder object, but the value associated with it has changed from getValue() to \"***Sensitive Data Redacted***\". This shows that the method's output includes a placeholder for sensitive data.\n\nBased on these observations, I can now draft an updated Javadoc comment:\n\n\"Returns a string representation of this object; useful for testing and debugging. If the name is not null, it will be appended to the string with \"Name: \". The value will also be included if it is not null, but sensitive data will be redacted by replacing them with asterisks.\"\n\nSo in code format, this would look like:\n\n\"{Returns a string representation of this object; useful for testing and debugging.

It marks this expectation by setting the \"lowx\" flag to true and continues checking the remaining characters of the string.\n- Decoding and validating the surrogate pair: If a high surrogate character is followed by its expected low surrogate, the method decodes the pair into a Unicode code point (a single integer value representing a character in Unicode) using the decodeSurrogatePair method.

If it does not, an error message is returned indicating that the character is not legal in XML.\n- Checking for normal characters: If a character is neither part of a surrogate pair nor a high surrogate, it is checked to see if it is a valid XML character.

You provided two different versions of the same Java method, one before and another after some changes. It seems you are looking for the Javadoc comments for each version. The Javadoc or \"Java documentation\" is a way to document your code in Java. This is done by writing comments within your code that are designed to be used as a way for people reading the code to understand what it does and how to use it.\n\n2. The original comment for the first version of your method was:\n   \"Obtains an instance from the specified unique name.\"\n   This comment explains that this static method accepts a string as input, and returns an object (an instance) based on that string.\n\n3. After you updated your code, this method changed to accept a different string parameter (`name` instead of `uniqueName`) and now calls another static method named `NAMES.parse(name)`. This change is reflected in the updated Javadoc comment as well:\n   \"Creates an instance from the specified name using the static method NAMES.parse(name).\"\n   This new comment explains that the method creates an object (an instance) based on a string input, but now it uses `NAMES.parse(name)` instead of just obtaining the instance. It also refers to the `NAMES.parse(name)` method as a way of creating this object, which wasn't mentioned in the original comment.\n\n4. Therefore, considering all these changes and points, I provided you with an updated Javadoc comment for your revised Java method that reflects all these modifications. This is done by adding more details about what exactly this updated method does.\n\n5.

It also handles transitions between different batch final states and ensures that no batch attempts another state change if it has already been completed successfully.", "The code you provided has a new method called `done`, which is different from your previous question. It receives three parameters: `baseOffset`, `logAppendTime`, and `exception`. The task is to update the Javadoc comment for this method based on the changes made in the updated code. Here's an explanation of what has changed and how it should be reflected in the Javadoc comment.\n\nIn the original code, the method returned a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on whether it successfully produced messages to a specific topic partition using a base offset. If the batch failed, it would return `false`. The method also used a `finalState` variable to represent the final state of the batch (success or failure).\n\nIn the updated code, there are several changes:\n1. The `tryFinalState` variable has been added to determine the final state based on whether an exception occurred during message production.\n2. The method now logs a trace message for both success and failure cases using the `topicPartition`, `baseOffset`, and `exception`.\n3. The condition for updating the final state has changed from checking if it's null to using `compareAndSet` with `tryFinalState`.\n4. The method no longer throws an exception when the batch has already been completed, but instead logs a debug message.\n5. The return value of the method has been changed from `true` or `false` to always returning `false`. This change is likely due to the fact that the original implementation might not have worked as expected, and the new version aims to fix this issue.\n\nBased on these changes, the updated Javadoc comment for the `done` method should reflect these modifications:\n\n\"\nComplete a batch operation by attempting to update its final state based on whether an exception occurred during message production. If successful, log relevant information and return `false`. If unsuccessful (i.e., the final state is not `null`), log debug messages accordingly and return `false`. This method no longer throws exceptions and always returns `false`.", "This method handles a request based on the given parameters. If there is no exception, it successfully produces messages with a given base offset and sets the final state to SUCCEEDED. If an exception occurs, it fails to produce messages and sets the final state to FAILED.

If `decay` is greater than 0 and less than 1, it multiplies the learning rate by `decay`. Finally, the method limits the learning rate to be within the range of `maxLearnRate` if it exists.

Similarly, if `decay > 0 && decay < 1`, the learn rate is multiplied by the decay value.

These variables were previously named 'exist' and 'attr'. This change may not be necessary if you prefer consistency with the previous version of the code.\n\n- Added a comment before each if condition explaining its purpose.
