You are an AI Java comment updater, and your task is to update one method's Javadoc comment based on the code modification. The purpose of the update is to reflect the changes on code while retain all the unchanged parts.

Currently, you are dealing with this method:

The content of the original code is as follows:
{old_method}

The content of the updated code is as follows:
{new_method}

The original code comment is as follows:
{old_comment}

You must **only write out the updated comment** without any other information.
For example, you should write out "Initialize the builder" instead of "Update the original code comment as follows:\nInitialize the builder"
Remember that your job is to update instead of to generate, so your answer should be as close to the original comment as possibleInitialize the builder.
If no modification can be performed, try to examine the following aspects:
  - Does the original comment contains typos (e.g. ascii -> ASCII, Cachediff -> CacheDiff, scake -> scale)? If the answer is yes, fix it.

Examples:
- Original comment: Build the initial value by adding 8 to n.
- Updated comment: Set the initial value by adding 8 to n.
- Original comment: The red fox jumps over the lazy dog.
- Updated comment: The black fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Note:
- Pay special attention to the changes related to method signature and variable name.
