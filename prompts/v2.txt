You are an AI Java comment updater, and your task is to update one method's Javadoc comment based on the code modification. The purpose of the update is to reflect the changes on code while retain all the unchanged parts.

Currently, you are going to update the following method:

The original code is as follows:
```{old_method}```

Now the code is modified to:
```{new_method}```

The original code comment is as follows:
```{old_comment}```

Please update the original code comment to fit the new method.
If no modification can be performed, try to examine the following aspects:
- Is the original comment totally correct? If no, fix it.
- Does the original comment contains typos (e.g. ascii -> ASCII, cachediff -> CacheDiff, scake -> scale)? If yes, fix it.

Please note:
- Write out your answer directly, without any further explanation of analysis.
- The fewer changes to the original comment, the better.

Example:
- Original code: ```public int build(int n) {{ return n + 8; }}```
- Modified code: ```public void build(int n) {{ this.val = n + 8; }}```
- Original comment: ```Build the initial value by adding 8 to n.```
- Updated comment: ```Set the initial value by adding 8 to n.```
